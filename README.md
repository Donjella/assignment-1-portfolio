# Brendon's Portfolio
This is my first portfolio website attempt made with HTML and CSS as part of Coder Academy's coding bootcamp's assignment. Therefore, considerations in designing and developing this portfolio website are based around the assessment's brief and rubric.

## Overview
This portfolio website consists of 5 pages. Namely, the home/index page, about me, services, projects and contact me. A HTML and CSS [Validator](https://validator.w3.org) was used  to ensure they are syntactically and semantically valid.

A cohesive visual theme is also achieved using a collection of font and color setting. The website uses a split-complemenatry color scheme to create a high-contrast color combination but yet maintain a clean, professional look. These predominantly used colors are declared as variables in the `:root` element/selector to ensure implementation of a 'theme'. It also shares a consistent header, footer, navigation bar and main content sections in all pages. Finally, curated fonts for the website are based on aesthetic purposes but also for accessibility. 

### Accessibility
Here are *some* accessibility highlights of the website. 

* The use of *semantic elements* are used throughout the pages' HTML to describe meaning to both browsers and developers.
* Other accessibility-related attributes such as the 'alt-text' for images and relative units such as '%', 'vw', 'vh' and 'rem/em' are used.
* The website primarily uses the "Inter", Helvetica, and 'Sans-serif' fonts, these fonts are curated for their 'sans-serif' decorative stroke (or lack thereof) to prevent readability issues.
* Media query breakpoints are used to ensure responsiveness in terms of tablet, mobile and desktop designs.
* Where possible, clickable elements are thoughtfully "sized" bigger on smaller devices and placed near the bottom of screen to improve usability of the website.
* Space between elements are carefully selected to help legibility and reduce accidental clicks.
* `_blank` target attribute allows users to stay on current page while navigating external links.


## Key features 
* Animated Logo
* Animated text on ***Homepage***.
* Hover effects on:  
  * "Meet me" button on ***Homepage***.
  * "Submit" button on ***Contact*** page.
  * "Project" and 'services' cards on ***Homepage***, ***services*** and ***projects*** page.
  * Navigation links and other links across all pages of the website.
* 'Project' cards on ***homepage*** are link to their specific projects on the ***projects*** page using anchor tags.
* Bouncing and sliding animation effects on social icons on ***About***, ***projects*** and ***contact*** pages respectively.
* `:focus` effects on contact form in ***contact*** page.
* Modern CSS and styling techniques such as Flexbox or CSS grid are used on ALL pages of the website.
* Relationship between pages are also deliberated in the design. I.e. pages are connected via links where possibile - e.g. on the ***homepage*** clicking "more" will lead you to services page and 'contact me here' will take you to  ***contact*** page.
